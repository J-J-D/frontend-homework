Hi Skyward!   Thank you for checking out my Weather app!   As a new developer, I think one of the most important skills I can conquer is adapting to new tech quickly.   So I decided to use this assignment to add more tools to my personal stack. Welcome to my first attempt at using Next.js and Tailwind CSS.   

TO RUN:

1) Clone this repo into a root folder
2) Go into your new folder 
3) Create .env file and add this Variable:
      NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_KEY = {your personal OpenWeatherAPI key}
      (Note your API key must work with the One Call by Call plan.  If you need one, contact me by email.)
4) Type 'npm install' in your terminal and wait
5) Type 'npm run build' in your terminal and wait
6) Type 'npm run start' in your terminal then go to localhost:3000 in your browser and check it out


ASSUMPTIONS:

1) English and Farenheit are the preferred currency
2) I am the only developer working on this so a Docker container is not needed

WAYS TO IMPROVE STILL:

1) Sunrise and Sunset Times are in Military Time and set to time zone of the client not the time zone for the city on display 
2) Needs a spinner while loading in case of delayed response
3) Additional Details button could look more like a button
4) Error Handling can be more robust so end user understands what has happened.

Thank you so much and I look forward to talking with you soon!
